Programmer.breath(); // => OUTPUT:

/* The object Programmer doesn't have a property breath(), so it looks in its proto, which is the object User,
User also doesn't have breath(), and it looks in User's proto, which is the object Human, Human has property 
breath(), so it will run.
And the output depends on what Math.random() will return, if > 0.8, the output will be "breath", otherwise "ğŸ˜´ ". */
